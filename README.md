## GitHub projects - User Stories 

  
To support an agile development methodology my chosen tool was GitHub projects. I outlined my prioritised user stories and extra features to ensure a MVP would be achieved.

## Frontend development - design elements 

PaddleHere is a fully responsive mobile first website. Due to our target users being "on the go", a mobile users perspective was at the forefront of most of the design decisions. A lot of the elements of the website reflect this, especially the design of the card. Familiar to most IOS users. And the use of back buttons throughout the website. With this in mind, buttons were purposely placed at the bottom of the users screen for ease of use for mobile and tablet users.  

Overall PaddleHere has a muted colour theme. A light blue accent colour for the obvious relation to water, but overall white to allow the blog posts (text) to stand out. To aid with the contrast of the white cards, #f9f9f9 was used. An off White, almost Grey. 

The font pairing was chosen for readability and to apply a brand image. To support this Genty was used for the brand logo,  a surfer esque font. The main text Montserrat, was used for it's blatant readability and versatility as it was being used across the site for headings, main text and to highlight details such as author names and post dates and times.
